# hello-world
Start to learn and create hello-world in Github.

I am a junier of Android Developer. I would like to create an app
that can support the people and make they time valuable.

So I plan to start to create simple one app ( Mobile Guide app ).
Now aday mobile is very popular in Myanmar. But it is not easy to
search and get the information of the phone.

They need to buy journal or going to the mobile show room or shop.
And asking for the information that they want.

so that I will create Mobile Guide app to help them to get the information
of all mobile.

I will use github for storing and hosting my project.

Thank you Github for your support for all developer.
